# RISC-V CPU Project

This project implements a custom RISC-V processor with pipelining, hazard handling, and cache integration. The design follows the RV32I base instruction set and is deployed on an FPGA for running hand-written assembly programs.

## Features

- **Five-Stage Pipeline**  
  Implements 5 pipeline stages with data forwarding and hazard detection to minimize stalls.

- **Hazard Handling**  
  Supports load-use hazard detection, branch hazard logic, and pipeline flushing.

- **FPGA Deployment**  
  Synthesized and deployed on an FPGA board to run and test custom RISC-V assembly programs.

## Tools and Technologies

- SystemVerilog  
- FPGA development board
- Xilinx Vivado

## Running Programs

1. Write or compile RISC-V assembly into machine code.
2. Load the program into instruction memory.
3. Deploy the design to the FPGA and reset the system.
4. Observe output via LEDs, UART, memory traces, or your testbench.

## Future Improvements

- Branch prediction  
- More advanced cache policies
